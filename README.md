## Who am I?

I'm a software engineer based in the Philippines ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­

## What I do

- Lead teams to meet project requirements and deadlines.
- Help stakeholders understand the technical aspect of the project and make key business decisions. (_Who do we hire? How many engineers do we need? Is the project doable in the given time frame? How soon can we launch?_)
- Design a project from the ground up.
- Write backend code and sometimes QA automation test scripts (gotta have them tests :wink:).
- Perform code reviews, daily stand-ups, sprint planning.
- Reduce Infrastructure cost by keeping things simple. (_Do you really need all those servers doing microservice with over the top engineering complexity just to service a User base of less than a 1,000?_)
- Write and Audit Smart Contracts.
